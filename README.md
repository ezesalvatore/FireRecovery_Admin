# Big Sur Land Trust Fire Recovery Monitoring - Admin Timelapse Generation Frontend

## Overview

This repository is the frontend that the administrator (Jenny Jacox) can use to generate a timelapse from hiker uploaded images in an organized way.

There are currently many flaws that need to be addressed, which I can help with, but I encourage you to take ownership over this project and make it your own.

## Technologies Used

### Next.js

This project is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework developed by Vercel. Next.js is widely used by industry leaders like OpenAI and Tesla due to its performance, scalability, and built-in optimizations. While it has a learning curve, it's a powerful tool, and I recommend leveraging **ChatGPT**, the **official documentation**, and **Stack Overflow** for assistance.

### TypeScript

The codebase is written in **TypeScript**, which is similar to JavaScript but includes **static type checking**. Although it requires some additional effort to write, it significantly improves debugging and code maintainability.

### Yarn

Instead of using **npm (Node Package Manager)**, this project uses **Yarn** (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) as the package manager. To install Yarn, run:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

## Mantine

Mantine is the UI library being used to import components to be used in the project. Mantine allows for easy styling and good looking components with little work.

## Google Cloud Authentication

Google Cloud Authentication is what is being used to login with your gmail account and access your google drive and sheets

# How to Run The Project:

In order to run the project you will need to use the command line and git to first clone the project onto your machine, then install the necessary dependencies, then run the project.

Open the command line (I use windows powershell), create a new folder, change the cwd (current working directory) to that folder and type 'git clone <RepoHTTPSLinkFoundUnderGreenCodeButton>'. This should clone the project into that folder that you created.

# Deployment:
